### Think Stats by Allen B. Downey

[Think Stats, 2nd Edition](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/index.html)

"This book is an introduction to the practical tools of exploratory data analysis," that uses a computational and project-based approach.

"If you have never studied statistics, I think this book is a good place to start. And if you have taken a traditional statistics class, I hope this book will help repair the damage."
