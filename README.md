## Think Stats by Allen B. Downey

[Think Stats, 2nd Edition](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/index.html)

"This book is an introduction to the practical tools of exploratory data analysis," and uses a computational and project-based approach.

"If you have never studied statistics, I think this book is a good place to start. And if you have taken a traditional statistics class, I hope this book will help repair the damage."

## Chapter 1

### pandas

  - dataframe contains a row for each record and a column for each variable

  - series is like a Python list with additional features

## Chapter 2

### distribution

  - the values that appear in the sample and the frequency of each

  - normal distribution

    - idealized bell-shape distribution aka Gaussian distribution

  - uniform distribution

    - a distribution in which all values have the same frequency

### summarizing distribution

  - central tendency

    - do the values tend to cluster around a particular point?

    - measured by the mean

  - modes

    - what is the most frequent value?

    - is there more than one cluster?

  - spread

    - how much variability is there in the values?

    - measured by variance

    - the square root of variance is the standard deviation

  - tails

    - how quickly do probabilities drop off as we move away from the modes?

  - outliers

    - are there extreme values far from the modes?
