"""
In Section 2.7 we computed the mean of a sample by adding up the elements and
dividing by n. If you are given a PMF, you can still compute the mean, but the
process is slightly different.

Write functions called PmfMean and PmfVar that take a Pmf object and compute the
mean and variance.

To test these methods, check that they are consistent with the
methods Mean and Var provided by Pmf.
